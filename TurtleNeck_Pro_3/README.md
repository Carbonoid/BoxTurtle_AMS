# TurtleNeck Pro 3 - Smart Filament Buffer for BoxTurtle AMS

The TurtleNeck Pro 3 (TNP3) combines the HW parts of the original TurtleNeck Filament Buffer with a small Raspberry RP2040 based MCU board: The Waveshare RP2040-Zero running Klipper. This allows to connect the TNP3 to your klipper host as another MCU via USB-C.
